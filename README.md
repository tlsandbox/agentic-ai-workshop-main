## Appendix: Understanding `app.py` 📝

The `app.py` file serves as the backbone of your application, connecting the **Streamlit** front end with the **Langflow-powered backend**. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

---

### **API Integration**

The `run_flow()` function is responsible for communicating with the Langflow backend:
- **Base API URL**: Retrieved from the `secrets.toml` file (`LANGFLOW_ID`, `ENDPOINT`, and `APP_TOKEN`).
- **Payload**: Sends user input to the backend in JSON format.
- **Response Handling**: Extracts the AI-generated response for display in the UI.

Code Snippet:
```python
def run_flow(message: str) -> dict:
    api_url = f"{BASE_API_URL}/lf/{LANGFLOW_ID}/api/v1/run/{ENDPOINT}"

    payload = {
        "input_value": message,
        "output_type": "chat",
        "input_type": "chat",
    }

    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer " + APPLICATION_TOKEN, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

---

### **Streamlit Front End**

The Streamlit front end provides an intuitive interface for user interactions:
- **Chat Input and Output**: Users submit queries, and AI responses are displayed as styled chat bubbles.
- **Sample Questions**: Buttons provide quick access to predefined queries.
- **Custom Styling**: CSS enhances the visual appeal of the chat interface.

Code Snippet (Input and Response Handling):
```python
# Display chat history
for message in st.session_state["messages"]:
    # User's message
    st.markdown(f'<div class="chat-bubble-user">{message["user"]}</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
    # Bot's response
    st.markdown(f'<div class="chat-bubble">{message["bot"]}</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

---

### **Custom Styling**

Custom CSS styles ensure the app is visually appealing and user-friendly. Example:
```css
.chat-bubble {
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
```

---

### **Secrets Management**

The `secrets.toml` file stores sensitive credentials:
- **Langflow ID**: Identifies the specific flow to connect.
- **Application Token**: Authenticates API requests.
- **Endpoint**: Specifies the Langflow backend entry point.

---

### **How It All Comes Together**

The app performs these key steps:
1. Users submit a query via the Streamlit interface.
2. The query is sent to Langflow through the `run_flow()` function.
3. Langflow processes the query using your custom flow and returns a response.
4. The response is displayed in the Streamlit UI, styled as chat bubbles.

- Customize its functionality for your specific use case.
- Add more features, like new buttons or additional styling.
